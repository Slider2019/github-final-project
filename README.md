# 📈 Simple Interest Calculator

A lightweight calculator that computes **Simple Interest** based on user-provided inputs: principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## 🧮 Formula

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
\]

Where:
- `P` = Principal Amount  
- `R` = Annual Rate of Interest (in %)  
- `T` = Time Period (in years)

## 🚀 Features

- Accepts input for principal, rate of interest, and time period
- Calculates simple interest accurately
- Beginner-friendly code structure for learning and educational purposes

## 📥 Input

```txt
Enter principal amount: 1000
Enter rate of interest: 5
Enter time period in years: 2
```

## 📤 Output

```txt
Simple Interest = 100.0
```
